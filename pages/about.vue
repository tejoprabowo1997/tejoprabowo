            My name is Tejo Prabowo, and I have a strong passion for programming and web development. I was born on
            April 2, 1997, in Tangerang, and I am currently based in the same city. With several years of experience as

            frameworks. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enable me to create visually appealing and
            interactive web applications. Additionally, I have expertise in utilizing popular web frameworks, such as

            detail-oriented and strive to deliver high-quality work that meets client requirements and exceeds
            expectations. Collaborating with cross-functional teams and staying up-to-date with the latest industry
            trends are also aspects that I value and actively engage in.

            Apart from my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and teamwork abilities, which contribute
            to seamless collaboration within projects. I enjoy working in a dynamic and challenging environment, where I
