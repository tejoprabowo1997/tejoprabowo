              <p>
                At PT. Quicksilver Bali Cruise, I worked as an internal company programmer. The company is engaged in
                the tourism industry. My role here was to develop internal applications required by the company,
                including payroll, attendance, accounting, and warehouse management apps.

              <p>
                In my role, I begin by understanding the company's business workflow and gathering feedback from users
                regarding any challenges they face within the company's operations. Based on this information, I proceed
                to design the application, starting from selecting the appropriate technologies, designing the database,
                and setting up a local server that can operate within the company's premises. Once these initial steps
                are completed, I proceed with creating a project plan to provide progress updates to my superiors
                throughout the application development process.

                The company operates in the construction and steel industry. In this company, my responsibilities and
                profession are similar to my previous experience. However, in this particular company, the task was
                quite challenging as I had to develop an application to manage complex material data. Despite the
                difficulties, I managed to complete the task through determination and patience.

                PT. ADALA TEKNOLOGI BANGSA is a startup company operating in the B2B E-commerce industry. Here, I work
                as a front-end developer. My main responsibility is to come up with ideas to create user-friendly yet
                elegant application interfaces. In this role, I have gained a lot of knowledge about content layout in
                applications because an e-commerce website needs to have an attractive design while ensuring efficient
                data retrieval from the backend.

                Roti Bakar 88 is a cafe and restaurant chain with multiple branches across Java Island. In this company,
                my job is exactly the same as at PT. QUICKSILVER BALI CRUISE. There are no challenging tasks here.
                However, I have plenty of time to learn about new technologies, such as developing microservice-based
                applications and studying programming languages like Go and Python, among others.

                Since 2021 until now, my main job has been freelancing. I usually get projects from friends or
                participate in project-based work for companies. In freelancing, I handle various types of work, such as
                designing article layouts, creating ecommerce websites, designing databases, and developing backend
                systems.
